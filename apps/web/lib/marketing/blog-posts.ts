None of this replaces a hands-on check by a technician, but it should help you decide whether you can wait until Monday or need to book today.",

By the time stopping distances have noticeably increased, you may already be scoring the discs, overheating calipers, or relying on one axle more than the other. Fixing that costs more than a straightforward pad change.",
